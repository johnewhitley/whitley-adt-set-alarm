I've created this perl script so that my home server can set my alarm for us if we forget to set it at night.

I used a lot of the source code from this other project, so I wanted to at least thank 'ScribbleJ' for providing the foundation for this project I've been wanting to complete for the past few months.

This script is created for ADT Pulse Home Security/Monitoring.

You can email me any time with questions @ johnewhitley@gmail.com
